Hi! My name is [Cristina Rodriguez ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/crissrodriguez/) and I am a software engineer. I received training from Hackbright Academy, an engineering bootcamp for women in San Francisco  (graduation: March 2017). And now I'm a 2018 recipient of the Grow with Google Challenge Scholarship to the Android Basics track. I used to work as a project manager in a software company and there I got interested in learning Python and being able to create my own software projects. I'm currently seeking an Android Developer role or a front-end developer role in the Great Seattle Area. If you have a role that I should hear about, feel free to email yosola at gmail.
